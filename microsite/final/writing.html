                <p>Dahl's first published work, inspired by a meeting with C. S. Forester, was "A Piece of Cake", on 1 August 1942. The story, about his wartime adventures, was bought by The Saturday Evening Post for US$1,000 (equivalent to $18,000 in 2022) and published under the title "Shot Down Over Libya".</p>

                <p>His first children's book was <i>The Gremlins</i>, published in 1943, about mischievous little creatures that were part of Royal Air Force folklore. The RAF pilots blamed the gremlins for all the problems with the aircraft. The protagonist Gus—an RAF pilot, like Dahl—joins forces with the gremlins against a common enemy, Hitler and the Nazis. While at the British Embassy in Washington, Dahl sent a copy to the First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt who read it to her grandchildren, and the book was commissioned by Walt Disney for a film that was never made. Dahl went on to write some of the best-loved children's stories of the 20th century, such as <i>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</i>, <i>Matilda</i>, <i>James and the Giant Peach</i>, <i>The Witches</i>, <i>Fantastic Mr Fox</i>, <i>The BFG</i>, <i>The Twits and George's Marvellous Medicine</i>.</p>

                <p>Dahl's children's works are usually told from the point of view of a child. They typically involve adult villains who hate and mistreat children, and feature at least one "good" adult to counteract the villain(s). These stock characters are possibly a reference to the abuse that Dahl stated that he experienced in the boarding schools he attended. In a biography of Dahl, Matthew Dennison wrote that "his writing frequently included protests against unfairness". Dahl's books see the triumph of the child; children's book critic Amanda Craig said, "He was unequivocal that it is the good, young and kind who triumph over the old, greedy and the wicked." Anna Leskiewicz in <i>The Telegraph</i> wrote "It's often suggested that Dahl's lasting appeal is a result of his exceptional talent for wriggling his way into children's fantasies and fears, and laying them out on the page with anarchic delight. Adult villains are drawn in terrifying detail, before they are exposed as liars and hypocrites, and brought tumbling down with retributive justice, either by a sudden magic or the superior acuity of the children they mistreat."</p>

                <p>
                    While his whimsical fantasy stories feature an underlying warm sentiment, they are often juxtaposed with grotesque, darkly comic and sometimes harshly violent scenarios. <i>The Witches</i>, <i>George's Marvellous Medicine</i> and <i>Matilda</i> are examples of this formula. <i>The BFG</i> follows, with the good giant (the BFG or "Big Friendly Giant") representing the "good adult" archetype and the other giants being the "bad adults". This formula is also somewhat evident in Dahl's film script for <i>Chitty Chitty Bang Bang</i>. Class-conscious themes also surface in works such as <i>Fantastic Mr Fox</i> and <i>Danny, the Champion of the World</i> where the unpleasant wealthy neighbours are outwitted.

                <p>His short story collection <i>Tales of the Unexpected</i> was adapted to a successful TV series of the same name, beginning with "Man from the South". When the stock of Dahl's own original stories was exhausted, the series continued by adapting stories written in Dahl's style by other authors, including John Collier and Stanley Ellin. Another collection of short stories, <i>The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar and Six More</i>, was published in 1977, and the eponymous short story was adapted into a short film in 2023 by director Wes Anderson with Benedict Cumberbatch as the titular character Henry Sugar and Ralph Fiennes as Dahl.</p>

                <p>
                    Some of Dahl's short stories are supposed to be extracts from the diary of his (fictional) Uncle Oswald, a rich gentleman whose sexual exploits form the subject of these stories. In his novel <i>My Uncle Oswald</i>, the uncle engages a temptress to seduce 20th century geniuses and royalty with a love potion secretly added to chocolate truffles made by Dahl's favourite chocolate shop, Prestat of Piccadilly, London. <i>Memories with Food at Gipsy House</i>, written with his wife Felicity and published posthumously in 1991, was a mixture of recipes, family reminiscences and Dahl's musings on favourite subjects such as chocolate, onions and claret.

                <p>For a brief period in the 1960s, Dahl wrote screenplays. Two, the James Bond film <i>You Only Live Twice</i> and <i>Chitty Chitty Bang Bang</i>, were adaptations of novels by Ian Fleming. Dahl also began adapting his own novel <i>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</i>, which was completed and rewritten by David Seltzer after Dahl failed to meet deadlines, and produced as the film <i>Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory</i> (1971). Dahl later disowned the film, saying he was "disappointed" because "he thought it placed too much emphasis on Willy Wonka and not enough on Charlie". He was also "infuriated" by the deviations in the plot devised by David Seltzer in his draft of the screenplay. This resulted in his refusal for any more versions of the book to be made in his lifetime, as well as an adaptation for the sequel <i>Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator</i>.</p>

                <p>He wrote the script for a film that began filming but was abandoned, <i>Death, Where is Thy Sting-a-ling-ling?</i>.</p>
