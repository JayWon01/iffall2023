        <h2>Vietnamese Coffee</h2>

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>The Vietnamese are serious coffee consumers and like their coffee really strong and bitter. But to counter that bitterness, sweetened condensed milk is used to create a bittersweet beverage which can be served both hot or cold.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons sweetened condensed milk, or to taste</li>
            <li>1/3 cup (80 ml) hot espresso prepared using an espresso machine, stove-top pot, French press or capsule machine OR 2-3 tablespoons freshly ground coffee</li>
            <li>ice cubes (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <p>To make Vietnamese coffee using espresso</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the sweetened condensed milk in the bottom of a glass.</li>
            <li>Add the hot espresso.</li>
            <li>Stir to dissolve the condensed milk and taste to see if you need to add more.</li>
            <li>For an iced coffee, add some ice cubes and serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>To make Vietnamese coffee using a traditional Vietnamese coffee filter (phin)</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the sweetened condensed milk at the bottom of a glass.</li>
            <li>Place the coffee filter on top of the glass.</li>
            <li>Place the ground coffee into the cup of the filter and then press it down with the removable press.</li>
            <li>Pour in a little boiling water to moisten the coffee. Wait a few seconds, and then slowly fill up the cup of the filter with boiling water.</li>
            <li>Place the lid on the filter and wait for the coffee to slowly drip into the glass. Depending on the size of your filter, this should take about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the filter.</li>
            <li>Stir to dissolve the condensed milk and taste to see if you need to add more.</li>

        <p>I like this website's use of large imagery. It does a great job of grabbing a user's attention and drawing them into clicking on the recipe. </p>

        <p>I like how this website is able to portray large amounts of information in a given space. I like its varying use of columns and rows to display different recipes and how seamless the transitions are as a user scrolls down. </p>

        <p>I like this website's for its page layouts and use of different colors. This website isn't primarily a recipe website, but it was pretty easy to navigate to its recipes page.</p>

        <p>I was really drawn to the minimalist and subtle look and layout of this website. I like the subtly of the font and how it allows the images to stand out more, which is something I would like to have when designing my rceipe webpage.</p>

        <p>I like this website's use of font and imagery, which I think are very bold. The transitions and user journey are also really seamless and the website itself is very navigable.</p>

        <p>I like how the user initlaly sees a full width image in the background, which is still well contrasted with the text that is over the image. The overall website is very sleek with its layout and font choices, which is something I will consider with my own webpage. </p>
